## About Me!
Hey there, I am Ashiv, a master's student in the Radar Remote Sensing Group at the University of Cape Town. My master's research project concerns developing mission planning software for tracking space debris with a radar system which we envisage building in the future. 

I have taught myself a bit of programming, astrodynamics, target tracking and numerical methods. I plan on showcasing some of the simulation software that I've built over the years here. You can take a look at what I've been doing on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AshivDhondea?tab=repositories).
